        Arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit.
            -r DISTRIBUTION_GROUP, --recipients DISTRIBUTION_GROUP
                    The distribution group name (from the 
                    mailList,json file) (required).
            -s EMAIL_SUBJECT, --subject EMAIL_SUBJECT

                    body of the email (required).
            -a N [N ...], --attach N [N ...]
                    A file or a list of files (using absolute paths and
                    separated by spaces) that will be attached to the
                    email. (optional).

    Description:
        This program is intended to be used as a Python module or to be called 
        directly from the command line or a shell script. The send_email 
        function should be used by different programs that need to send 
        notification emails (E.g. csr_checker.py and sccm_error_log_emailer.py).
        The fact that this is an independent function allows to have a better 
        control and easier maintenance while editing this code (instead of 
        having the same function replicated in several .py files).

    Modification list:
        CCYY-MM-DD  Author           Description
        2017-06-23  Alan Verdugo    Improved path string concatenation.
                                    Implemented logging functionality.
                                    Minor improvements.
        2017-08-25  Alan Verdugo    This script can now be called independently
                                    (for example, from the CLI or a shellscript)
        2017-08-29  Alan Verdugo    Separated the send_email() function into 
                                    build_email() and send_email().
                                    Added the ability to add attachments.
        2017-09-26  Alan Verdugo    Fixed some bugs.
